* Texas Instruments 99/4
* born in Florida, Chicago since 1998, various places in between

* I bounced around a little bit before becoming a teacher, including time as a dishwasher, a prep cook, five years as a cabinetmaker, and a few other things. As a teacher, I taught Special Education for thirteen years, French during one of those years, and now computer science for nine years
* Here's a work by (or based on instructions from?) Sol Lewitt. "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art." <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/teaching-materials/singular-forms-sometimes-repeated-art-from-1951-to-the-present/sol-lewitt-1928-2007#:~:text=a%20perfunctory%20affair.-,The%20idea,-becomes%20a%20machine">Sol Lewitt</a>
